# DayZ Simple ESP
A simple project to understand the basics of reverse engineering on memory to retrieve the correct offsets.

This project is based on the game DayZ in offline mode. It retrieves entities around the player to mark them on the screen. The project is in development. For now, it only displays the position of entities and the player in the debug menu. Translating the received data to display it as ESP is still in progress.

The offsets are based on version 1.25 of the official DayZ version. Offsets change with each version.
